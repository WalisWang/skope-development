The purpose of this repo is to have a single repo to checkout the entire platform for development, no matter which sub-system is being worked on.

This repo is not for deploying the platform.

## Directories

- `configs` stores all the config files used by the containers. The settings could put the services/apps into verbose mode, for example, for development purposes.
- `runtime-data` is reserved for all the runtime data generated by the containers. For instance the data generated by ElasticSearch.
- `web-app` is a submodule directory for the Meteor app.
